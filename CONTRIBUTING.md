# Contributors Guide

First off, thanks for considering contributing to the project. It's contributions like yours that make this project great.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

HowTo Guide is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, writing blog posts, and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into HowTo Guide itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for **support questions**, if you need support in anyway send an email to [learndevfoundation@gmail.com](mailto:learndevfoundation@gmail.com).

## Ground Rules

* We expect all community members to respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
* We expect all community members to be respectful and considerate to each other.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Check out the [Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

## Your First Contribution?

Unsure where to begin contributing to HowTo Guide? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: This are issues that are labelled as **Good First Issue** and **Help Wanted**. These are issues that are not yet resolved and are waiting for your contribution and should not be to difficult to resolve.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
