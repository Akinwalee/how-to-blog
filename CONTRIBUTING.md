# Contributors Guide

First off, thanks for considering contributing to the project. It's contributions like yours that make this project great.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

HowTo Guide is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, writing blog posts, and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into HowTo Guide itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for **support questions**, if you need support in anyway send an email to [learndevfoundation@gmail.com](mailto:learndevfoundation@gmail.com).

## Ground Rules

* We expect all community members to respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
* We expect all community members to be respectful and considerate to each other.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Check out the [Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

## Your First Contribution?

Unsure where to begin contributing to HowTo Guide? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: This are issues that are labelled as **Good First Issue** and **Help Wanted**. These are issues that are not yet resolved and are waiting for your contribution and should not be to difficult to resolve.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting Started

No matter how small your contribution is it is welcome. Examples of contribution welcome are:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another.
* New features / functionalities.

To contribute to this project:

1. Create ypur own fork of the code.
2. Do your changes in your fork.
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, send a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

Any security issues should be submitted directly to [learndevfoundation@gmail.com](mailto:learndevfoundation@gmail.com) In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [learndevfoundation@gmail.com](mailto:learndevfoundation@gmail.com).

If you are sure your issue is not a security issue, then you can report it to the issue tracker.

## New features

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in HowTo Guide, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that HowTo Guide has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code Reviews

Pull requests are reviewed by a group of people. The group of people is called the code review team. The code review team is responsible for ensuring that the code is well-written, well-commented, and well-tested. This review is done on a regular basis.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to the community that we will continue to improve HowTo Guide. We will continue to add new features, fix bugs, and improve the codebase. We will also continue to maintain the codebase and ensure that it is well-written, well-commented, and well-tested.
