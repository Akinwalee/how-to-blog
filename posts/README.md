# Contribute a blog post.

To contribute a blog post, you'll need to write a markdown file. Create a folder for your blog post and in this folder you would need to add three (3) files:

1. A `.md` file for your blog post. This file should have the title of your blog post.
2. A `.md` file titled `README.md` which is a summary of your blog post and should contain the authors name and a link to your twitter profile.
3. An image for your blog post.

This folder should have the title of your blog post. And should be in the `posts` folder. [Here](./posts/sample/) is a sample submission.
